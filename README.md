# Headlight-Dimmer-Circuit

**Problem Statement and Objective**:

Road accidents happen every day and they are more frequent during the night time. This is because visibility is not good during night time.
Thus, automatic headlights are the latest convenience in today’s cars. These eliminate the need for the driver to dim or switch off the headlights manually in most of the situations. The automatic headlight dimmer acts as the human eye to outside light levels, and independently dims or brightens as and when needed. Such a system offers both safety and convenience.

The general problem is to design a system which can analyze road conditions to identify situation in which automatic headlight dimmer circuit could enhance visibility, and thereby substantially improve safety and/or comfort for road users. The main goal of this proposed project is to discuss ways in which the present, headlight systems in automobiles could be improved by making them dynamic and more adaptable to the everchanging road conditions, mainly curves.

**Applications:**
1.	 It works as a human eye to outside light levels. It dims the light according to the brightness outside.
2.	 This mechanism can also be used in mining. Miners won’t have to adjust their lights while in dark places.
3.	 It can be used in foggy and rainy conditions.
4.	 It can be used as building perimeter lights. The lights can become bright or dim according to outside light conditions.

**Limitations:**
The major limitation of this prototype comes when one of the two vehicles coming from opposite directions has its high beam on and the other has its low beam on. This will reduce the distance at which the switching occurs and may still cause a glare to the driver using low beam lights. Also, this prototype does not solve the problem of the glare from the rear, which is caused by the vehicles that use high beam lights moving closely behind another vehicle.

**Future Scope:**
It can also improve by deciding it is not to affect by street lights and other light, it is not very successful in India but in future all the car manufacturer company may think about it for install in all the vehicles. The cost of this system is across 5000–7000 per vehicles and its life is almost 10 years and it can reduce the problem of road accidents at night due to dazzling of light and problem of glare. An automatic dimmer could play a crucial role in shifting the headlights from driving beam to meeting beam and vice versa. This will improve visibility by minimizing glare, a major cause of momentary loss of vision. The realization of the ultimate goal of total road safety through creating ideal visibility conditions is dependent on efforts in all other related areas.
