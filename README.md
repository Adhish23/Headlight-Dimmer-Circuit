# Headlight-Dimmer-Circuit

**Problem Statement and Objective**:

Road accidents happen every day and they are more frequent during the night time. This is because visibility is not good during night time.
Thus, automatic headlights are the latest convenience in todayâ€™s cars. These eliminate the need for the driver to dim or switch off the headlights manually in most of the situations. The automatic headlight dimmer acts as the human eye to outside light levels, and independently dims or brightens as and when needed. Such a system offers both safety and convenience.

The general problem is to design a system which can analyze road conditions to identify situation in which automatic headlight dimmer circuit could enhance visibility, and thereby substantially improve safety and/or comfort for road users. The main goal of this proposed project is to discuss ways in which the present, headlight systems in automobiles could be improved by making them dynamic and more adaptable to the everchanging road conditions, mainly curves.
